# Mindefender

## Overview

Mindefender is an AI safety layer for traders that runs on-device to detect stress signals through micro-facial analysis, typing pace, and focus patterns during high-risk trading actions. When stress is detected, it pauses the trade to show a rapid risk checklist (size, leverage, stop, thesis) to prevent impulsive trades and enable clearer decisions. Privacy-first with all analysis running locally on your device.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- A webcam (for facial stress detection)
- **HTTPS required for mobile camera access** (see Mobile Setup below)

## Install

```bash
npm install
```

## Run (Development)

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 📱 Mobile Camera Setup (REQUIRED for phone/tablet)

**Mobile browsers require HTTPS for camera access.** If you're testing on a phone, choose one option:

### Option 1: LocalTunnel (Fastest - No setup needed!)

```bash
npm run tunnel:local
```

This gives you an instant HTTPS URL to open on your phone. ✅ Camera works immediately!

### Option 2: Local HTTPS with mkcert (For repeated testing)

**Windows:**
```powershell
.\setup-https.ps1
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x setup-https.sh
./setup-https.sh
```

Then follow the on-screen instructions to trust the certificate on your phone.

📖 **Complete Guide:** See [MOBILE_HTTPS_SETUP_GUIDE.md](./MOBILE_HTTPS_SETUP_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.

Run (Production)

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Key Features

- Stable face analysis (MediaPipe FaceMesh) with EMA smoothing and temporal median filtering
- Watchdog + simulated fallback to avoid dead-ends on camera failure
- Real-time performance metrics (FPS and per-frame latency) in the UI
- Configurable thresholds for detection confidence and blink hysteresis
- Quiet console: verbose logs only in DEV with VITE_DEBUG=true

Face Analysis Settings

Adjust at runtime from the Face Analysis card when detection is active:
- Detection confidence: `minDetectionConfidence` (also applied to tracking)
- Blink thresholds: `blinkCloseThreshold` and `blinkOpenThreshold` (hysteresis)

Environment Flags

- VITE_DEBUG=true enables verbose debug logging in development

Performance Targets

- 24+ FPS and median per-frame latency ≤ 80 ms on typical hardware

Tech Notes

- Vite configured to suppress runtime overlays and lower log verbosity in production
- TypeScript strict mode; UI built with Radix + Tailwind utilities

Troubleshooting

- No camera access: the app switches to simulated metrics automatically
- Noise in console: ensure `VITE_DEBUG` is unset or false in production
