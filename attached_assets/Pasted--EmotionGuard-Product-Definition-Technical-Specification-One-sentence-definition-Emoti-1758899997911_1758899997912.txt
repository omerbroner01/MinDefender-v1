# EmotionGuard — Product Definition & Technical Specification

## One-sentence definition

EmotionGuard is a pre-trade **“stress CAPTCHA”**: a fast, privacy-preserving checkpoint that detects trader stress in real time and then **allows, delays, or blocks** the order—optionally guiding a short cooldown—so firms reduce impulsive, emotion-driven losses without disrupting normal flow.

---

## Problem & motivation

* **Emotion-driven trading is expensive.** Stress spikes and “revenge trades” increase error rates, widen stops, and produce outsized losses that concentrate firm tail risk.
* **Existing controls are post-hoc.** Journals, PnL circuit breakers, or after-action reviews trail the decision; they don’t intercept the **moment** of risk.
* **Regulatory & reputational pressure.** Firms, brokerages, and platforms face growing expectations to implement **duty-of-care** and **harm-minimization** controls (esp. for retail/CFD/crypto).
* **Operational reality.** Traders want speed, not friction. Any intervention must be **sub-2 seconds** (for a quick pass) and **rare**, yet effective when it matters.
* **Measurable business need.** Reducing a small fraction of impulsive loss events materially improves desk PnL volatility, retention, and compliance posture.

---

## Target users & environments

**User segments**

* **Retail traders** using broker/exchange UIs (web & mobile).
* **Prop firms** (futures/FX/crypto) seeking discipline & risk controls.
* **Brokerages & exchanges** adding pre-trade wellness/compliance.
* **Copy-trading & social platforms** protecting followers from cascades.

**Environments & integration points**

* **Desktop/Web:** Order ticket, hotkey trade, and one-click buy/sell → **pre-order hook** calls EmotionGuard SDK/API.
* **Mobile:** Trade confirmation sheet → overlay check before submission.
* **Programmatic (optional later):** Pre-trade API policy gate for approved client apps; not in MVP.

---

## Core concept (Stress CAPTCHA)

EmotionGuard inserts a **time-bounded** checkpoint just before an order is sent:

1. **Trigger:** Pre-order hook fires with context (instrument, size, leverage, PnL streak, time-of-day, volatility).
2. **Assessment (policy-driven):**

   * **QuickCheck** (≤1.5s): passive behavioral/keystroke signals + optional face presence; returns **Risk Score** + **Go/Hold/Block**.
   * **InterferenceCheck** (6–10s): brief Stroop-like task + self-report slider; optional voice prosody; returns **Risk Score** + verdict.
3. **Intervention:** If risk high, apply **graduated response**: warn → cooldown (guided breathing) → block with **override+reason**.
4. **Audit:** Log signals, decision, explanation (no raw media by default), and trader’s optional note for later review.

## AI/ML components (detailed)

1. **Signal ingestion & normalization**

   * Inputs: reaction time, accuracy, mouse/tap deltas, keystroke rhythm, blink presence, optional voice prosody, self-report, order context (leverage, size relative to median, recent PnL, instrument volatility, local time).
   * Normalization: device class (mobile/desktop), network RTT, time-of-day, per-instrument baselines.

2. **Voice emotion analysis (optional)**

   * Features: pitch contour, jitter, shimmer, energy variance, formants; 1–2s sample.
   * Output: **Arousal score (0–1)** with confidence; processed on-device where supported; never store raw audio by default.

3. **Micro-expression classifier (optional webcam)**

   * Task: detect stress cues (brow furrow rate, blink rate change, gaze fixation).
   * **No identity**; no face templates persisted; compute ephemeral features only.

4. **Cognitive challenge model**

   * Stroop-like interference: latency & accuracy under color-word conflict; adaptive 3–6 trials.
   * Output: **RT z-score vs. baseline** + error rate.

5. **Behavioral biometrics**

   * Micro-latency, jitter, backspace bursts, cursor path entropy during confirm; anomalies vs. personal baseline.

6. **Fusion model**

   * **Context-aware ensemble** (e.g., Bayesian or stacked logistic) combining modalities into **Risk Score (0–100)** + **uncertainty**.
   * Inputs weighted by availability & policy; degrade gracefully.

7. **Adaptive thresholding**

   * Per user and context (instrument risk class, leverage); maintain target **false-positive rate** and **miss rate** bands.

8. **NLP summarizer (journals)**

   * Compress short free-text journal into 1–2 sentence, **compliance-friendly** note with tags (“revenge trade,” “FOMO,” “fatigue”).

9. **Drift monitoring & auto-recalibration**

   * Track baseline drift; trigger low-friction micro-checks outside trading hours; recalibrate thresholds automatically.

## Our “crazy patent”: Adaptive Multi-Modal Stress Gate (AMSG)

**Claim (concept overview):**
A method that **(a)** establishes a personal baseline using periodic, low-friction micro-checks; **(b)** applies a **time-bounded cognitive interference task** interleaved with **passive signals** (voice, micro-expression, behavioral jitter); **(c)** fuses all signals via a **context-aware Bayesian/ensemble model** calibrated to market conditions; **(d)** outputs a **verdict with confidence in <1.5s** for QuickCheck (and <10s for InterferenceCheck); and **(e)** enforces **graduated interventions** (warn → cooldown → block → supervised override) while **logging explanations** and preserving privacy (**no raw media persistence** by default).

**Why novel / superior vs single-signal checks**

* **Multi-modal robustness:** Combines cognitive impairment, autonomic cues, and interaction anomalies → higher AUC, fewer false blocks.
* **Context-aware:** Thresholds adapt to user, instrument, leverage, and volatility regime.
* **Latency-tiered:** Dual-mode design (QuickCheck/InterferenceCheck) keeps most trades frictionless while catching high-risk spikes.
* **Privacy-first:** Ephemeral media features + explainable summaries—deployable in stricter jurisdictions.
* **Operationally practical:** Fits in existing pre-order flows with deterministic budgets and auditable logs.

## User flows (step-by-step)

### 1) First-run onboarding & baseline creation

1. Trader sees brief **intro & consent**; selects allowed modalities (voice/cam optional).
2. Run **baseline pack**: 2× reaction mini-tasks (30–45s total), background micro-latency sample, optional face-presence calibration, optional 1s voice vowel.
3. Store baselines (no raw media) + consent record.
4. Success toast: “Pre-trade checks will be fast; you can change privacy at any time.”

### 2) Normal pre-trade gate (happy path)

1. Order ticket → **pre-order hook** calls `eg.checkBeforeTrade`.
2. **QuickCheck** executes (≤1.5s): behavioral + optional face-presence; fuse with context; **Risk Score** computed.
3. Verdict **Go** → submit proceeds; event logged (score, reason tags, policy version).
4. Optional post-trade micro-check prompt if volume high or sequence suggests fatigue (policy flag).

### 3) High-stress detected → cooldown & journaling

1. Verdict **Hold/Block** → modal explains brief reason (“RT high + self-report 8/10”).
2. Offer **30–60s breath-guided cooldown**; timer visible; cancelable with **override+reason** (if policy allows).
3. Prompt **micro-journal**: emotion + plan (“Reduce size to X; wait for setup”).
4. After cooldown, re-check: **Go** or keep **Hold**; if override used, log **supervisor alert** (optional).

### 4) Admin policy update → live config propagation

1. Admin adjusts strictness preset (per desk/instrument class) in console.
2. Config change generates **signed policy version** and pushes to SDK via config CDN/polling (≤1 min).
3. Next checks use new thresholds with version recorded in each event.

### 5) Incident review in Admin console

1. Risk manager filters events by **Block** or **override**.
2. Opens incident: sees context, reasons, journal summary, and subsequent outcomes (PnL, MFE/MAE).
3. Marks as **TP/FP** and optionally tunes policy (A/B flag) for upcoming sessions.
4. Export CSV/PDF for audit.

  * **No raw media storage by default**; ephemeral RAM features only.
  * Role-based access; per-tenant API keys; signed policy versions; tamper-evident audit log (hash chain).
* **Auditability:** Exportable CSV/PDF; event schema versioned; policies & thresholds versioned.
* **Scalability:** 100 RPS/tenant baseline; burst to 500 RPS; horizontal autoscale.
* **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA; keyboard-only; screen reader labels; color-blind safe palettes.

---

## Privacy & ethics

* **Data minimization:** Collect only features needed; aggregate where possible; redact free-text journals (PII detector).
* **Opt-in modalities:** Camera/mic always optional; function without them.
* **On-device inference options:** Voice prosody & face-presence can run locally; only features/score sent server-side.
* **Explicit consent UX:** Clear micro-copy; ability to change at any time; explain outputs & overrides.
* **Explainability:** Show reason tags (e.g., “reaction slow vs your baseline”).
* **Bias checks:** Monitor FP rates across device classes/time zones; instrument-specific thresholds to avoid penalizing e.g., high-volatility scalpers.
* **Regional compliance:** Mode presets (no camera/audio); data residency options; retention windows per region.

---

## Integration model

**SDKs (initial: Web)**

* **Initialize:** `eg.init({ tenantKey, policyUrl, region, features })`
* **Check:** `eg.checkBeforeTrade(orderContext)` → `{ riskScore, verdict, reasons, policyVersion }`
* **Events:** `eg.on('decision', handler)`; `eg.on('error', handler)`

**API hooks (outline)**

* `POST /v1/score` — inputs: userId, deviceClass, orderContext, availableSignals; returns score, verdict, reasons, uncertainty, policyVersion.
* `POST /v1/events` — log overrides, journals, cooldown completions.
* `GET /v1/policy` — current signed policy & experiment flags.

**Webhooks (tenant-side)**

* `decision.created` (verdict + reasons)
* `override.used` (user, reason, score)
* `policy.updated` (version, checksum)

**Sample integration points (outline only)**

* **Pre-order**: call `checkBeforeTrade` just before `placeOrder()`.
* **Post-order** (optional): attach decision id for downstream analytics.
* **Admin SSO** (later): OIDC to console.
